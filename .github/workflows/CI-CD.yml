# This GitHub Actions workflow builds and tests the TraxAct application.
# It runs on push and pull requests targeting the master branch.
# The workflow sets up the .NET environment, installs the Java Development Kit (JDK),
# adds Roslyn analyzers, installs .NET MAUI, builds the project, runs code analysis,
# runs tests, performs CodeQL analysis, and handles deployment to different environments.
